  Cordelia Smythe is the ficticious namesake of a murder mystery dinner party
  company based in northern California. When we were contracted to redesign
  their ecommerce website, we knew we had to emphasize this special character.

  We spent a lot of time with the client hashing out the content, design, and
  presentation of their website to ensure it matched the level of care and
  detail they put into all of their mysteries.  In order to keep the process
  fast and efficient, we utilized CodePen to rapidly iterate through ideas.

  The first deliverable we worked on was the [Brand
  Profile](https://codepen.io/bobbyshowalter/full/25790e277f284af192a958fba1a295e9/).
  Since we were reusing the majority of the content from the old design, this
  step gave us an opportunity to define the building blocks for the rest of the
  elements in the design. Using the brand profile, we created mockups for some
  of the primary content components&mdash;like telegrams, postcards, and
  notes&mdash;as well as a full-page mockup for an individual mystery feature.

  Iterating through these pieces in a dependency-free environment like CodePen
  kept us focused on the task at hand, and made sure we weren't getting caught
  up in too many distracting details. Our goal for the design was to pull the
  user into the world of Cordelia Smythe before they received their murder
  mystery. We think we captured Cordelia's spirit well, and the client was
  thrilled with the result.
