  Lori has been a family friend for nearly a decade, so we were thrilled when
  she asked us to design her photography studio's website. Her beautiful
  photography is featured heavily throughout the site, of course, but we
  focused most of our attention on the admin panel.

  Making sure Lori had the tools and interface necessary to keep the site
  current was a very important goal during our process. We worked closely with
  Lori to understand her ideal workflow, and used a combination of built-in
  WordPress functionality and extra plugins to craft an editing experience that
  would be as delightful as her pictures.

  Empowering clients to feel confident in their website is an important
  objective of ours. We have a [case
  study](https://www.bshow.co/2018/04/17/ltb-photography-and-admin-ux/) of the
  admin panel work available on Bobby's blog.
